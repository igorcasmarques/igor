# Skills and Tools

I am a musician by training, but my career now focuses on technical writing. Here are some technical documents I can create:

- **Reference**: Product documentation, user manuals, white papers, reference guides, wikis
- **Learning**: Instruction sets, tutorials (text and video), course outlines
- **Internal comms**: Proposals, reports, project plans, Gantt charts, memos  
- **Graphical**: Data visualizations (graphs, charts, etc.)

I have skills and knowledge of tools in four areas: [technical writing and editing](#tech-writing); [collaboration and project planning](#collaboration);  [accessibility compliance](#accessibility); and [programming](#programming).

## Technical Writing and Editing {#tech-writing}

- Develop traditional and code-based information content for print and web with the goal to inform, instruct, and persuade readers
- Use plain language and task orientation to create documents from a user-centric perspective
- Profile audiences, collaborate with subject-matter experts, and conduct research to ensure accuracy and practicality
- Edit documents authored by myself and others in three levels (comprehensive, copyediting, and proofreading) to produce error-free content
- **Tools**: MS Office Suite, XML, Markdown, Docusaurus, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, Snipping Tool, OBS Studio, WordPress
- **Languages**: Fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; Advanced French (CCBB)

## Collaboration and Project Planning {#collaboration}

- Gather internal and external data to execute unified content strategies that streamline information processes
- Create forms and reports that help secure and increase funding for departments
- Make Gantt charts and project plans to make sure projects stay on schedule and validate the needs of stakeholders
- Leverage source control to organize, synchronize, and back up team efforts in small- and large-scale projects
- **Tools**: Git/GitHub, MS Project, MS Teams, Zoom, Google Docs, Slack, Learning Management Systems (Blackboard, Moodle, Brightspace), MediaWiki

## Accessibility Compliance {#accessibility}

- Design explanatory and narrative-driven data visualizations that minimize cognitive load
- Check and adjust content for adherence to accessibility guidelines and standards such as [WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and [AODA](https://www.aoda.ca/what-are-aoda-standards/) 
- Rely on industry and in-house style guides to ensure authored content follows best practices of universal design
- **Tools**: MS Office's Accessibility Checker, Colour Contrast Analyzer

## Programming {#programming}

- Convert legacy data into modern data formats in fully modularized and refactored code with reusable variables
- Design static and dynamic web pages with friendly UI/UX
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, YAML, Markdown, PostgreSQL, AWS/S3

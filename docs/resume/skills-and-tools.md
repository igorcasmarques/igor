# Skills and Tools

Here's an overview of the technical content I create:

- **Reference**: Product documentation, user manuals, [white papers](../portfolio/technical-writing/strata-g-matrix-system), [technical descriptions](../portfolio/technical-writing/hb-pencil-with-eraser), reference guides, FAQs, wikis
- **Learning**: [Instruction sets](../portfolio/instructional-design/borrowing-physical-items), tutorials (text and [video](https://www.youtube.com/@musictheory1017/videos)), [course outlines](https://kb.osu.edu/items/a22af78d-7425-4075-8240-b4d6845e30b0), ADDIE-based instructional material
- **Internal documents**: [Proposals](../portfolio/technical-writing/minimizing-turnover-disruptions), reports, project plans, Gantt charts, memos  
- **Visual work**: [Data visualizations](../portfolio/visual-communication/intro) (graphs, charts, etc.), screenshots and screen recordings, webcam presentations

I've organized my skills and tools below in four areas: [technical writing and editing](#technical-writing-and-editing); [collaboration and project planning](#collaboration-and-project-planning);  [accessibility compliance](#accessibility-compliance); and [programming](#programming). 

## Technical Writing and Editing

- Develop traditional and code-based information content for print and web with the goal to inform, instruct, and persuade readers
- Use plain language, task orientation, and terminology management to create crystal-clear documents from a user-centric perspective
- Profile audiences, collaborate with subject-matter experts, and conduct research to ensure accuracy and practicality
- Edit documents authored in four levels (proofreading, copyediting, comprehensive, and production) to produce error-free content
- **Tools**: MS Office Suite, MadCap Flare, XML, Markdown, Docusaurus, Adobe Photoshop, Snipping Tool, OBS Studio, WordPress
- **Languages**: Fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; Advanced French (CCBB)

## Collaboration and Project Planning

- Gather internal and external data to execute unified content strategies that streamline information processes
- Create forms and reports that help secure and increase funding for departments
- Make Gantt charts and project plans to make sure projects stay on schedule and validate the needs of stakeholders
- Leverage source control to organize, synchronize, and back up team efforts in small- and large-scale projects
- **Tools**: Git/GitHub, MS Project, MS Teams, Zoom, Google Docs, Slack, Learning Management Systems (Blackboard, Moodle, Brightspace), MediaWiki

## Accessibility Compliance

- Design explanatory and narrative-driven data visualizations that minimize cognitive load
- Check and adjust content for adherence to accessibility guidelines and standards such as [WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and [AODA](https://www.aoda.ca/what-are-aoda-standards/)
- Combine inclusive language, cultural sensitivity, and fact-based writing to remove biases from texts
- Rely on industry and in-house style guides to ensure authored content follows best practices of universal design
- **Tools**: MS Office's Accessibility Checker, Colour Contrast Analyzer

## Programming

- Convert legacy data into modern data formats in fully modularized and refactored code with reusable variables
- Design static and dynamic web pages with friendly UI/UX
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Python, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, YAML, Markdown, PostgreSQL, AWS/S3

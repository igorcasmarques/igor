I've organized my skills and tools below in four areas: [technical writing and editing](#technical-writing-and-editing); [collaboration and project planning](#collaboration-and-project-planning);  [accessibility compliance](#accessibility-compliance); and [programming](#programming). 

## Technical Writing and Editing

- Develop traditional and code-based information content for print and web with the goal to inform, instruct, and persuade readers
- Use plain language, task orientation, and terminology management to create crystal-clear documents from a user-centric perspective
- Profile audiences, collaborate with subject-matter experts, and conduct research to ensure accuracy and practicality
- Edit documents authored in four levels (proofreading, copyediting, comprehensive, and production) to produce error-free content
- **Languages**: Native English, Spanish, Portuguese; [Advanced French](@site/static/resume/skills-and-tools/tcf-2020.pdf)

# Personal Traits

In the 20 years and many positions I've had since my first job at a used record store, I've learned to:

- Communicate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds and ages
- Adapt quickly to new tools, processes, and evolving priorities
- Thrive both individually and as a team member
- Maintain a pleasant attitude even in stressful situations
- Turn problems into opportunities and make the most of limited resources 
- Execute administrative responsibilities with care and timeliness
- Prioritize the companyâ€™s good over my own ego and personal credit

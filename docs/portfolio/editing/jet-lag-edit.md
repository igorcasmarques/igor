## Excerpt: Original

The situation, which is called as jet-lag, is observed  when travelling across a number of times zones during prolonged flights from east to west and from west to east. The jet-lag appears with the signs differing from person to person, and results oftenly from conflict between body clock and destination clock.

Jet-lag is in mild  form during  the flights from east to east, and it generally does not pose any problems, but it appears especially as weakness, fatigue, anxiety and insomnia during the flights from west to east.

## Excerpt: Edited

Jet lag is observed[^1] in people travelling across a number of time zones in prolonged flights from east to west or from west to east. Signs of jet lag differ from person to person and often result from the conflict between the traveller’s biological clock and the destination’s clock.

Jet lag occurs in mild[^2] form during[^3] flights from east to west and generally does not pose any problems except for some weakness, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia.


[^1]: Revise sentence to use active voice instead of passive voice, e.g. “People travelling across several time zones experience jet lag…”
[^2]: Consider whether you also need to include something about west-to-east flights, since jet lag is worse in this case and it is the direction of outbound North American flights to Turkey.
[^3]: Revise sentence to avoid suggesting that jet lag occurs *during* flights because its effects happen *after* flights.

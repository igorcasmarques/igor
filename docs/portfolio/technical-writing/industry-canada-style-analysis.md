## Executive Summary

The Industry Canada Style for Writers and Editors ([1997](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2021/isde-ised/C23-128-1997-eng.pdf), [2002](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection/C2-469-2002E.pdf)) was a manual intended to address writing concerns particular to publications of the former Industry Canada department, now known as Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED). This “quick style and usage reference for busy people” provided brief answers to issues Industry Canada’s staff would have commonly encountered while preparing departmental publications, including appropriate punctuation, bilingual requirements, naming conventions for government agencies, and more.

Industry Canada’s writers—especially new hires—must have found value in having this manual at hand, but it did not offer them much that was not already available in other sources, so it is understandable that it would become obsolete as:
- the Internet made it increasingly easy to consult these other sources;
- the Government of Canada centralized style guidelines; and,
- the majority of ISED’s written content moved from print to the web.

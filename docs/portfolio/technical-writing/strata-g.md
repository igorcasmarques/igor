## Executive Summary

The purpose of this white paper is to recommend Canadian dentists to adopt the Strata-G™ sectional matrix system to make Class II restorations easier and more precise, mitigate patient anxiety, and cut costs.

An estimated 14 million Canadians feel uneasy—or worse—about going to the dentist because they are afraid of feeling pain during dental procedures.[^1] If they have cavities, these people may choose to delay treatment and wait until their condition worsens and offers them no other choice but to see a dentist. Then, when they finally seek treatment, their agitation and the difficulty of the restoration can make the situation unpleasant for both patient and dentist.

Yet, restorations do not need to be traumatic. Dentists who rely on the right tools and techniques to perform Class II restorations can:
- Ensure fillings are quick and comfortable and break the patient’s cycle of anxiety
- Eliminate gaps between teeth and minimize prospects of pain after the procedure
- Help patients be more cooperative and seek dental care more often
- Employ durable instruments to lower the impact on their clinic’s budget

This is what the Strata-G™ sectional matrix system can deliver. Those interested should visit the [Strata-G™ website](http://www.stratagmatrix.com/) for more information. The Strata-G™ standard kit costs Can$724—an initial investment that pays for itself down the line—and can be [ordered online](https://www.garrisondental.com/strataGkits) or by phone by calling 1-888-437-0032.

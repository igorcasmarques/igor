## Summary

[Tally Pie](https://github.com/igorcasmarques/tally_pie) is an [open-source](https://github.com/igorcasmarques/tally_pie/blob/main/LICENSE.md) desktop app for counting and categorizing content with a dynamic pie chart. You can create pie charts with up to six wedges very quickly with Tally Pie's simple user interface (UI). As you increment or decrement wedges, the pie chart changes in real time to reflect the evolving sizes of wedges.

Tally Pie is great for conducting quick ad hoc surveys, like:

- Keeping score in party games
- Doing a quick opinion poll with friends
- Counting household objects
- Categorizing content on social media

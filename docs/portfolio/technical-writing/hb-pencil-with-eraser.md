## Summary

An HB pencil with eraser is a small tube-shaped writing implement with a bit of exposed graphite on one end and a cylindrical rubber on the other. The pencil’s graphite, commonly known as lead, leaves marks on paper that are erasable by the rubber, which is ideal for correcting mistakes on the fly.

While many types of pencils exist, the most common wooden pencil with eraser is called #2 in the US and HB elsewhere. It has a usual length of 19 cm out of the box and a diameter of 7 mm that peters out about 2 cm before ending on a point at the lead tip.

There are two primary uses for HB pencils: writing down notes and drawing sketches. This makes them a fixture of offices, art studios, and classrooms. The pencil’s lead also makes marks on wood, cardboard, fabric, and drywall, so HBs are a mainstay of workshops and construction sites as well.

HBs also last a long time and can write tens of thousands of words, which translates to a month or two of assiduous use—or much longer in the case of sporadic writers.[^1] In fact, HBs are so cheap and convenient that they can be found in most homes, workplaces, and schools, resisting the increasing takeover of computers and smartphones.[^2]

However, pencils are not always appropriate. They do not work on glass, ceramic, or plastic. Likewise, pencils are not suitable for situations that require permanent written marks, like signatures on legal documents, because the erasable pencil marks tend to fade over time.

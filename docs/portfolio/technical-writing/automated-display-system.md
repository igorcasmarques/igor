[Download the full PDF](@site/static/portfolio/technical-writing/automated-display-system.pdf)

This user manual is the capstone project of Algonquin College's [Technical Writer Certificate Program](https://www.algonquincollege.com/sat/program/technical-writer/). I made it with [Ato Dankwa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ato-dankwa-a82194269/) and [Polina Gankina](https://polinagankina.myportfolio.com/).

## Summary

This is the user manual of an automated display system that was designed for the [Ingenium museums in Ottawa](https://ingeniumcanada.org/) by students in the [Electrical Engineering Technology program at Algonquin College](https://www.algonquincollege.com/acce/program/electrical-engineering-technology/).

The purpose of this user manual is to show Ingenium team members how to use the automated display system to measure and control the lighting of museum items. Tailoring the lighting to the characteristics of an item on display has the following benefits:

- Better viewing experience for the museum visitors
- Prevention of light-related damage to the item

This user manual has five parts:

1. Introduction of the user manual
1. Descriptions of the automated display systemâ€™s case and web app
1. Setting up the automated display system, including powering up and automating
1. Handling the automated display system, including adjusting by hand and maintaining
1. Reference material

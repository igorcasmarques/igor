**Disclaimer**: Private information in this proposal has been redacted. The app suggested by this proposal, easyclinic, is no longer available.

## Summary

The purpose of this proposal is to suggest that the team members of a dental practice in Ottawa  adopt the easyclinic app to streamline training and inventory management and thus achieve better staff retention.

Dental practices in Ottawa are suffering from a staffing crisis; employees like dental assistants and hygienists are hard to find and retain. This problem often incurs heavy costs for the practice and creates a lot of stress for team members.

A well-designed app can help mitigate the negative effects of turnover. This app must be:
- User-friendly: Intuitive to learn and start using effectively in half a month.
- Reliable: Able to show data about procedure setup and inven¬tory status at any time.
- Secure: Able to keep the logs of the practice’s activity safe from ill-intentioned people.
- Cost-effective: Affordable to roll out and lead to better staff retention and inventory management in four to six months, which will save hundreds of dollars every month.[^1]

The easyclinic web app meets these criteria. It makes training new hires and managing and restocking the inventory simple and quick. Because of these features, it can help reverse the vicious cycle of turnover. This will reduce mistakes and delays, improve the mood in the practice, and make patients feel more satisfied. 

And easyclinic does all of this for free.

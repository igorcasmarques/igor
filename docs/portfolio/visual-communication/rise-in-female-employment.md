## Redesign

In the past 45 years, many events have negatively affected the percentage of young Canadians with full-time jobs: the early 1990s recession, the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, and most recently the COVID pandemic. One group of people, however, has continued to make gains in the Canadian labour force throughout the years in spite of these crises: women aged 25-34 (Chart 5).

Since peaking in the late 1980s at 64.8%, the full-time employment rate of young men aged 15-24 has largely declined, reaching 57.3% last year. Likewise, men aged 25-34 have been on a slight but long-term downward trend since the first Labour Force Survey in 1976, going from 90.3% then to 86.2% now.

The situation has been different for women. Young women aged 15-24 lived through similar fluctuations as their male counterparts, but ended up overtaking them in the 2010s, making it to a 60.2% employment rate in 2022. For women aged 25-34, the growth has been uninterrupted and much more dramatic: a 60% increase in employment rate between 1977 and 2022, from 50.8% to 81.1%.

This performance is more than a mere economic phenomenon and has to do with the many educational and professional advances women in these age groups have made in the past half century as well as evolving norms regarding the role of women in society.

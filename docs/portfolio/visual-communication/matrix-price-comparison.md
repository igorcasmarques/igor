# Matrix systems price comparison

Strata-G™’s efficiency translates to cut costs. This includes indirect savings, like attracting more patients and fitting more procedures in the schedule, but it also refers to expenses directly associated with the purchase of matrix systems. The figure below compares the estimated cost[^1] of Class II restorations using Strata-G™, Palodent®, and Tofflemire systems:

As observed, Strata-G™’s heftier initial investment pays off in the long run and justifies the ease, efficiency, and precision it offers.

[^1]: Only the cost of matrix systems (bands, wedges, retainers) is considered; all other required materials and instruments, like rubber dams, composite, etc. are not factored in.

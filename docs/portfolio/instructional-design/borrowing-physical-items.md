## Summary

These instructions will show you how to borrow physical items from the Algonquin College Library. This service is available to anyone with a valid AC Card.

You can access much of the Libraryâ€™s catalogue directly online, but some resources are only available in physical formats, like print books and DVDs. These physical items are easy to borrow and can be valuable research aids.

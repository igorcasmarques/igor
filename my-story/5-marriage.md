*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) and [portfolio](/docs/portfolio/intro) in different areas of this site.* 

## Identity crisis

I turned twenty-three in 2011 but did not feel like an adult. In my mind, I was still the wide-eyed teenager from Curitiba. I didn't have a clear artistic voice, my portfolio was unremarkable, and my creative output was mutating from "impressive for my age" to "not sure how this will help me get a job" and "maybe I should've become a diplomat like my dad wanted."

Meanwhile, my older cousins were finishing their undergraduate degrees and getting jobs, showing me what professional success looked like for international students like us. Their steps became my roadmap: 

1. Attend university with an [F-1 student visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment).
1. Secure a job after graduation during the "practical training" grace period.
1. Have the employer sponsor the transition from F-1 to an [H-1B work visa](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b).
1. Live out the required number of years on H-1B to qualify for permanent residence, i.e., the [Green Card](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card).[^1]

My cousins were also getting married and having babies by then. None of them considered going back to Brazil a viable option. They all wanted to make a life for their families in the US—as did I. 

So, I set a couple of goals to help me accomplish it.

### Goal 1: Terminal degree

All of the (living) composers I knew and admired had gone to grad school. No (living) composer I knew was making enough money to raise a family by writing music right out of undergrad. Ergo, I needed to get a master's and a doctorate in music composition if I were to get any good at it, and if I got good at it, I'd land a permanent, well-paying, visa-sponsoring job.[^2] 

... right?

It'd take me much longer than my cousins to get to the coveted H-1B step, but eventually I'd get there, and then it would all have been worth it. I would've had my cake and eaten it too.

### Goal 2: Family

Vero and I had always had a serious, marriage-oriented relationship. In 2010, we talked about our future and chose to get engaged. We spurned the custom that appeared to prevail in the US that a man should propose to a woman on one knee, seemingly out of the blue, with an expensive diamond ring and a specific short-term wedding date.

In Brazil, engagement was an agreement, not a surprise ultimatum one sprang on the other, and both the man and the woman wore plain gold bands when they got engaged—somewhat dear, but still a fraction of the price of the engagement rings people go into debt for in the US. The discussion that culminated in the decision to get married could happen in a specially romantic or significant place for the couple, but usually there were no theatrics involved. Engaged couples then invited their family and friends to a party to announce and celebrate their engagement, and remained engaged for up to a few years until the conditions were right to get married.[^3]

When I visited Vero in Chile in 2010, we got our wedding bands—courtesy of my maternal grandmother—and announced our engagement to our families and friends. We thought it'd be a good idea to get married in December 2011. Vero would be done with university coursework and would need an just additional half year to undertake a mandatory practical internship. Incidentally, as an international student in the US, I could defer my studies for a half year, making me able to move to Chile and support her during her internship. 

## Concepción

Vero and I got married in the church building of the University ward in Concepción. The ceremony itself took place in the chapel and was officiated by a justice of the peace (JP). Vero had stressed to me how important it was to be punctual because Chilean JPs were notoriously impatient with delays, but she acted against her own advice and arrived half an hour late to our wedding. I was freaking out, but luckily our JP didn't seem to mind Vero's tardiness. 

After we were married, the JP left and Vero and I went to the nearby campus of the [University of Concepción](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Concepci%C3%B3n), her alma mater, to take pictures with a photographer. Meanwhile, our guests started on the appetizers in the church building's cultural hall.

Our wedding reception was modest but plentiful and fun. Dozens of relatives and friends attended—including my parents, siblings, and an aunt that worked tirelessly that day to decorate the hall we held our reception in. We ate a delicious meal prepared by the catering business Vero worked for on weekends and danced until late that night.

After the reception, we travelled 500 km north to Santiago, where we were [sealed in the temple](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/what-happens-in-a-temple-sealing?lang=eng) the following day. This ordinance extended our civil marriage beyond death, and deepened our commitment to each other. Then we flew to Uruguay and spent our honeymoon in Punta del Este.

### First apartment

A week later, Vero and I were back in Concepción. We lived in a tiny one-bedroom apartment on Ongolmo, close to Paicaví and Carrera, a central area in the city with lots of young people like us. Nights were rough for me because our neighbours were loud and drunk people often argued and fought in front of our apartment building. Vero slept through it all.

As the seasons changed, we experienced some of the most terrifying windstorms I've ever seen. One time, I was walking back from church alone on Sunday when I heard a heart-stopping noise. A powerful gust had lifted a large zinc sheet from a building behind me and sent it dancing in the air, thundering with each flutter.

Another time, there was such an intense driving rain that water was spouting violently out of the rabbets of our apartment's windows. The putty on those windows was old and spotty, so I had an idea: stuff the rabbets with thin plastic bags, like the ones grocery stores used to give customers back then. Vero laughed and laughed, but it worked. It didn't look great, but it worked. 

I still brag about the presence of mind I displayed that day, and Vero still laughs. But I've never minded her laughing. I love to make her laugh more than anybody else.

### Censo 2012

Before long, Vero settled in her routine doing her internship while I looked for a job. Money continued to be a pressing issue because we didn't have savings and Vero's internship didn't pay. I'd also been taught, for better or worse, that a man's worth depends on his work ethic and his ability to financially support his family. Since I was not studying, I had to work.

My first job in Concepción was at a radio station, selling ad space. I hated it and quit after my first paycheque.

Then, I learned about a well-paid, temporary gig for the government that aligned perfectly with our time frame. Chile would hold its [decennial census in 2012](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censo_chileno_de_2012), and they were looking for an army of census takers. Mysteriously, I applied and got the job, even though no one else we knew who had applied—and there were many in our age group—had been selected.

I **loved** working for as a census taker. It was all of the fun parts of my mission minus the rejection and heartache. I walked the streets of Concepción 10 hours a day, going from home to home and interviewing people about their lives and their families. I met people across the socioeconomic spectrum, from well-to-do traditional families to destitute squatters.

Being a census taker could be funny, too. Many people did not understand the questions we asked—or what the census itself even was, for that matter. This led to some confusion.

#### Material

I had to ask people what their residences were made of. Most people had no idea. Some people answered "material," which is as vague and obvious in Spanish as it is in English. They said it with such confidence, too! I soon learned that some old-timers used "material" in opposition to wood, so it basically meant brick and mortar or reinforced concrete.

#### Being indigenous

When people declared they were indigenous, the mandatory follow-up question was about their ethnic group. For indigenous people, the answer was straightforward. Those who self-identified as indigenous but didn't have strong ties with a particular group were generally stumped. Some walked back and said they weren't actually indigenous. Others doubled down and said that all Chileans should consider themselves indigenous and picked the Mapuche as their ethnic group because they represented anti-colonial resistance.

#### Polyglots

The census asked people about the languages they spoke. It was not uncommon for upper middle-class parents to proudly state that their children spoke two, three, four languages. It was not just parental pride; it was a matter of social prestige and a return of their investment. 

In Chile, private K-12 schools were the norm for middle-class families. This included lower middle-class families, who prioritized private education as soon as they could afford it. Some private schools for the upper social classes in Concepción distinguished themselves from the rest by offering foreign-language immersion programs and calling themselves the "British" or the "French" or the "Arabic" school. This fed into the people's strong pro-foreigner (especially pro-European) bias.

I'd spoken with Chileans in English and had good reason to doubt those kids spoke all of those languages fluently, but I put down whatever their parents told me.

#### Audífonos

The word for "hearing aid" in Spanish is "audífono," which is the same word for "headphones." One of the questions I had to ask was, 

*"Do you have difficulty hearing, even with a* hearing aid *on?"* 

Some young people who didn't know what hearing aids were thought I was asking them, 

*"Do you have difficulty hearing when you have* headphones *on?"* 

"Well, yes," one young man told me. "I like to listen to loud music and can't hear anything when I've got my headphones on."

I wasn't supposed to question people's answers and had to record exactly what they said, but  whenever this confusion happened, I'd clarify what type of "audífono" this question referred to.

"Well, then no," they would amend.

## Vero's graduation

After the census ended, I felt empty. I could only watch so much The Office and play so much Batman: Arkham City on my PlayStation before I felt an itch to resume "my life" in Orem. It was selfish. I did have a lot to do that fall in addition to my university courses:

- Polish my portfolio
- Take the Graduate Records Examination (GRE)
- Apply to grad school
- Write my capstone project

But I should've stayed a little longer in Concepción. If I had arranged an accommodation to miss the first few weeks of classes at BYU, I wouldn't have missed Vero's commencement ceremony in September 2012. That was my first big lapse of judgment as a husband.

Being a good and loving husband has been a learning process for me. I've never been abusive or mean, but I wasn't very affectionate at that stage, and I didn't prioritize my wife like I should have. 

I hope I know better now.

[^1]: Some of my cousins were able to speedrun this process by marrying US citizens. 
[^2]: It was clear to me that many composers-slash-producers that worked for recording studios and media (TV, movies, advertising, etc.) didn't need these credentials. But I didn't want to write music for media or produce pop albums. My experiences at BYU had changed my ambitions; my dream of writing [music for video games](/my-story/1-from-curitiba-to-provo.md#video-game-music) gave way to a plan to become an academic composer and professor. I figured this would give me the most freedom to pursue my crazy ideas.
[^3]: Getting engaged in Chile was similar enough.

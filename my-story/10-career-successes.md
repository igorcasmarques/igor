## The Orem-Amherst move

I arrived in Utah in late July 2015, while Vero and Samuel stayed behind in Chiguayante. My brother and a cousin of ours helped me put my family's stuff in a small container for a moving company to haul across the country for us, and I began the 3,100-km journey to Amherst on our beloved hatchback, a 2011 Nissan Versa.

People romanticize road trips. Not me.

Growing up, my parents took my siblings and me on many long road trips, especially to visit my grandparents who lived in Rio de Janeiro and Goi√¢nia, 10 and 12 hours away from Curitiba, respectively. If I tried to read a book or do crossword puzzles, I got carsick. If I rested my head against the window, my parents scolded me. 

"It's too dangerous," they said. "In the event of a car crash, you'd die instantly."[^1]

Music helped with the boredom whenever decent radio stations were available. Sometimes we also played silly games to pass the time, like finding vehicles of a certain colour, but these games got old pretty quick. And then there was nothing to do but sit upright, wait until I got tired enough to sleep, then hope that by the time I woke up we would have arrived at our destination.

My parents and my sister reminisce about these road trips with fondness. They're some of their most treasured memories. I guess our perception is different.

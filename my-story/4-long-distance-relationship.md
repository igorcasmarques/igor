## In-person V-days

After I was honourably released from my mission, I met with [Elder Richard Scott](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/leader/richard-g-scott?lang=eng), a member of the Church's [Quorum of Twelve Apostles](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/quorum-of-the-twelve-apostles?lang=eng). Among other things, he told me that my next priority should be finding an "eternal companion." My mind went to Vero.

I finished my mission in May 2009, four months before I had to resume my studies at BYU, and I chose to spend that time in Curitiba. Vero had broken up with her previous boyfriend some time before and agreed to come to Brazil to see if we were a good match.

We were. We clicked instantly. She smelled good and I liked the way she spoke Spanish. We had fun getting to know each other and going to Curitiba's tourist destinations. I even serenaded her with a song I'd written on the piano. When we were in line at a fast food joint, I hugged her from behind, she turned her face around, and we kissed for the first time. I still get butterflies in my stomach thinking about that moment.

When I felt shy about telling her something, I spelled out the words on the palms of her hand with my index finger, Helen Keller-style. After she'd been in Brazil for a few days, we found ourselves in the back of my parents' car on a long road trip. I asked her, "Will you be my girlfriend?," with my tactile writing system. She said no; she wanted me to "propose" out loud and in a more appropriate setting.

A few days later, I asked her again, out loud in a better place, and she said yes. We agreed to have a long-distance relationship while we were in university, and I promised to do my best to visit her in Chile at least once a year on my summer breaks.

My parents loved Vero. After she went back home, my father told me he'd support our relationship and covered the cost of an airfare to Chile so I could see her again before going to Provo. I met Vero's family and friends, and fell more in love with her.

## Classical 89

When I finally returned to Provo, I landed a job interview at the university's classical music radio station, [Classical 89 (KBYU-FM)](https://www.classical89.org/). It was the perfect fit for me, a music major and classical music nerd.

### Interview

The interview was a bit more intense than I expected. At one point, one of the interviewers asked me if I was able to tell the conductor and orchestra of a recording just by listening. No way. Not even nowadays. He said he could. It was not a weird power move; he was a nice guy and hoped to bond with me by nerding out together.

The interviewers wanted to make sure that:

- I was passionate about classical music.
- I could write "my way out of a paper bag."
- I had a good voice for radio.

I checked two out of these three boxes; my accent and lack of experience got in the way of the third. Nevertheless, I got the job.

### Job duties

They gave me the title of *assistant producer* and told me that that was not the position that I had applied for—that had gone to another young man—but that they had liked me and wanted to keep me because another student was going to graduate soon anyway. 

I worked happily at Classical 89 until I graduated in 2013.

My main tasks were: 

- Assist with the logistics of concert recordings
- Edit and package interviews and live performances for the air
- Support the full-time announcers in their shifts
- Record my own shifts on weekday evenings and weekends

I've always chosen my words carefully because I hated being misunderstood as a child. Being an assistant producer at Classical 89 helped me elevate that personality trait into communicative power. I learned a lot by reading aloud what I'd written and then revising it until it sounded good enough to say it on the air.

### Crisis of self-awareness

One day, I checked out a portable Zoom recorder. Strangely, I noticed that the recorder's storage was almost full, even though everyone tended to format the recorders before checking them in. I listened to the recording to find out who'd left it there so I could ask for their permission to clear the memory and use the recorder for my project.

It was the young man who had gotten the position I had applied for. I'd been working with him for several months and I thought he was a nice guy. In the recording, he was interviewing his wife, as a joke.

Then, out of nowhere, he began to role-play as me.

He put on a thick accent and started acting stupid. In his role-play, he, or rather, *I* was courting his wife like a lustful jackass while she refused my advances, laughing. I thought it was weird that she acted like she knew who I was, even though we'd never met. Was I the person that couple liked gossiping about? Were there other people who thought I was like that?

I didn't hear the whole thing. I couldn't, I was too perplexed. Maybe that parody of me was a truer version of myself than the person I thought I was. But I was not offended. I've always enjoyed making people laugh, regardless of the reason.

I pondered on the rare and fleeting nature of self-awareness. In the years since, I have accepted self-awareness as one my life's most elusive goals, and made peace with the fact that I may never know who I really am,[^1] or who I appear to be to other people.

Incidentally, I wish I had saved that recording.

## Chile 2010

Vero had a friend from Chiguayante, her hometown, who had moved to Provo recently. I'd met her in Chile and thought she was great fun, so we met up once or twice that year. On 27 February 2010, she called me in the morning.

### 27F

"Have you had any news from Vero?" Her voice wavered with a hint of desperation. "I can't get in touch with my family!"

"Why? What's wrong?"

"You haven't heard?"

"Heard what?"

"There's been a massive earthquake near Conce, one of the worst ones ever! And a tsunami, too. Phone, internet, nothing's working, so nobody knows if people there are OK." (She was right; that earthquake, nicknamed 27F, remains the eighth most intense seismic activity in recorded history.)

We commiserated with each other and tried calling, emailing, using social media, anything to reach the people we loved down there. Eventually, she was able to talk to her family, and I got a call from Vero, who apparently had borrowed a satellite phone. 

Vero told me that the earthquake had been vicious, that her family was OK, and that their home appeared to have suffered no structural damage. Life was complicated with severe aftershocks, looting, damaged roads, and a lack of services, but they were safe albeit traumatized and constantly on edge. She told me not to worry and that her family, neighbourhood, and Church ward were managing. Then she hung up.

Vero has fascinating stories about that time, but they are hers to tell. On my end, all I could do was wait and hope for the best.

### World Cup

Chileans are proud of their resilience and the country soon resumed activities, even though many people continued to struggle for years with the after-effects of 27F.

When I visited Chile that summer (which was winter in the Southern Hemisphere), I was most impressed by the ruins of the [Alto Río](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edificio_Alto_R%C3%ADo), a 15-storey building near the Biobío river that broke in half and collapsed during the earthquake. An [imposing but controversial memorial](https://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/atanacio-soza-arquitectos-memorial-27f-a-potential-symbol-of-drastic-change) was erected near the site of the Alto Río in 2013.

I also noticed that 27F had become a scapegoat for problems that clearly antedated it, so I started joking with Vero and blaming 27F for any inconvenience I encountered.

2010 was a World Cup year as well, and Chileans were excited about the prospects of their national team. The Chilean squad did very well in the tournament until they had to go against Brazil in the round of 16, at which point they were properly thrashed, 3-0. That could've caused some friction with my girlfriend, but she was as Brazilian as she was Chilean, and felt comfortable with whatever outcome of that match. 

## Year 3 at BYU

Fall 2010 marked the beginning of my third year in university. Academically, I was doing very well and qualified for a full-tuition bursary.

### ALMA

Whenever I was not in class or at work, I spent most of my time in the [Advanced Lab for Music Applications](https://music.byu.edu/facilities/electronic-facilities) (ALMA) in BYU's Harris Fine Arts Center (HFAC). The ALMA had row after row of MIDI keyboards, each with a pair of headphones and a computer with all the music and audio apps I could want. The ALMA was located in a weird annex of the HFAC, away from most foot traffic, so it became a sort of sanctuary for me. 

I thought back to my reticence about applying to BYU, and the ALMA made me feel grateful for my parents' insistence.

### Move to Orem

In late 2010, my parents decided to spend a small fortune they had been saving to buy a condo in Orem near exit 273 of the I-15. It had high ceilings, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a nice balcony with a view of the Wasatch Mountains. It was a couple of blocks away from [WinCo](https://www.wincofoods.com/), my favourite grocery store ever, and about 5 km away from the scenic Utah Lake.

That condo would be my home until 2015. I loved living there and never took it for granted.

As 2011 rolled around, life was going well. I was excelling in university, I loved my job and my condo, and I had all the support I needed to feel stable and happy. I talked to Vero every night, which was no replacement for us being *physically* together, but was enough to carry me over until the summer.

Still, I began to sense a new spectre nearby: my quarter-life crisis.

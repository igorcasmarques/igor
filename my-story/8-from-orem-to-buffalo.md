*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) and [portfolio](/docs/portfolio/intro) in different areas of this site.* 

## Time for a PhD

Only three of the 10 doctoral programs I applied to advanced my application to the next admissions round: the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/academics/music/composition-ma-phd/) (UCLA); the [Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/music/curriculum-and-degree-information/composition-concentration) (CUNY); and the [State University of New York at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/programs/music-composition-phd.html) (UB).

### UCLA

UCLA had me travel to Los Angeles to "audition" for them. 

After taking a test on music theory and history, I sat down for an interview with the graduate admissions committee of the School of Music. They grilled me on aural skills and some more theory. At one point, after I said I liked [Webern's Symphony](https://youtu.be/Xq2gwuKDPnY?si=kG_G3iJ8Z9c_eA09), a senior member of the committee asked me if I could recite the piece's P0—an arbitrary series of twelve notes—from memory and explain how it permutates in the exposition of the first movement.

I could not. He could.

Toward the end of the interview, a young faculty member wanted to discuss one of my portfolio pieces, an orchestral work titled *Purple Robe*. I wrote it for the BYU Philharmonic while I was still an undergrad. 

*Purple Robe* starts out as a thicket of uncoordinated noise that gradually gives way to a baroque vocalise. It's very expressive. The part I like the best is the transition between the last bit of noise and the baroque part, when the orchestra's percussionists clap. It's ridiculously simple but it gives me goosebumps.

I didn't impress the UCLA committee enough to get a spot in the program and they wait-listed me, which was just as well because they hadn't exactly passed my vibe check either. I found the people to be as stuffy as the air there. I also wanted to go somewhere less connected with Hollywood.

Not to mention the traffic in LA...

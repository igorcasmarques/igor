## Solo road trip

People romanticize road trips. I don't. 

Growing up, I went on many long road trips with my parents, especially to visit my grandparents who lived in Rio (10 hours away from Curitiba) and Goi√¢nia (12 hours away from Curitiba). If I tried to read a book or do crossword puzzles, I got carsick. If I rested my head on the window, my parents scolded me because it was dangerous. There was nothing to do but sit upright, wait until I got tired enough to sleep, then hope that by the time I woke up we would have arrived at our destination.

My parents and my sister reminisce about these road trips with fondness. They're some of their most treasured memories. I guess our perception is different.

As an adult, I'd gone on road trips with Vero and discovered that they could be bearable, even fun. Here's my conclusion: the quality of a road trip rests on six factors:

- Dependability of roads
- Beauty and variety of scenery
- Comfortable stops
- Loving company *and/or*
- Exciting destination
- Onboard entertainment (for passengers only)

When I took our family car from Orem to Amherst, I had a surprisingly good time, too, in spite of the 3,000 km between the two places.

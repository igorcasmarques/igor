*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) and [portfolio](/docs/portfolio/intro) in different areas of this site.* 

## "Express" entry

In the span of a single week in the spring of 2020, Vero and I went from hoping things would magically work out in the US to losing all hope to wholeheartedly deciding to go to Canada instead.

As soon as we had made this decision, Vero started reading every blog post and government webpage she could find about the immigration process. When she didn't understand something, she'd pop the question in one of the Facebook groups that she'd joined and get an answer in minutes, thanks to beauty bias.[^1]

She'd then relay what she'd learned to me. 

### Points

Vero told me that our safest best was entering the [Federal Skilled Worker](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers.html) program in the [Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) system. This process would require every last penny we had (and a little extra that I'd have to "borrow" indefinitely from my mother), but it made immigrating possible.

She also explained that people in the Express Entry pool were ranked using a point system, and that points were given according to criteria like age, family size, education, etc. Then, every so often, Express Entry would invite the top-ranked candidates to apply for permanent residence.

### All or nothing

"You know what's the best part?," she teased me.

"No, what's the best part?"

"If we get an invitation to apply for permanent residence, we're basically in. We just need to send our documents, do some medical exams, and wait for them to make sure everything we sent them is legit. The hard part is making the cut."

"Can you imagine what a relief that would be? Permanent residence... But how hard is it for us to get enough points?" 

"It's... doable, but not easy." 

Vero had been tracking the cut-off scores of past rounds of invitations. 

"Your PhD helps, our savings help, but we still need to get perfect marks in the English test," she explained. "And we need to do it soon, because I think the cut-off scores are getting higher, and may soon be out of reach for us."

"So... we need to go all in, right now. Are you sure you wanna do it?"

"I am," she replied.

"Then I am too," I said, leaning on her confidence.

### « Tu parles français, n'est-ce pas ? »

"There's just one thing," she mentioned.

"What?"

"If you get good marks on the French test, our profile will be much better ranked."

"I don't speak French. I picked up a few things when we went to [Paris](/my-story/12-elias.md#paris), but... I don't speak French."

"I know. But you can learn it. You have two months."

I trusted Vero and booked my [*Test de connaissance du français*](https://apprendre.tv5monde.com/en/tcf) (TCF) that same night, not knowing how to speak French. 

I was done with work at UB, so I started using Duolingo and watching French shows and movies on Netflix for hours on end, every day. 

Then, eight weeks later, between Independence Day and the *prise de la Bastille*, I drove 11 hours down to Raleigh, NC, whose [Alliance française](https://www.afraleigh.org/page/1642293-home) was the only place close-ish to us that was offering the TCF in the middle of the pandemic.

## Biding our time

When the results of our language proficiency tests came back, we were relieved. Vero and I got the scores we needed in English, and even though I didn't do well in my oral interview in French, I got top marks in *compréhension écrite et orale*. 

We were in the Express Entry safe zone. Now we just needed to wait to receive the invitation to apply for permanent residence.

We'd read that the typical Express Entry process took six months from start to finish. We had to leave the US four months after submitting our Express Entry profile, so a part of me hoped that we'd get lucky and our application would be processed faster than usual. 

I just wanted to hop across the border and be done with instability in our life.

## Curitiba, again

After coming back from Raleigh, I spent the rest of the summer taking my sons on long walks around our neighbourhood. We especially liked going to [Dellwood Park](https://www.amherst.ny.us/content/parks_detail.php?park_num=park_0021) and getting cold treats at the 7-Eleven a block away from our home.

Soon, it became obvious that we wouldn't be able to go to Canada just yet. So, we decided to go back to Curitiba and wait out the processing of our application there, where we had a solid support system and our expenses would be minimal.

### Last month in the US

A few days after we bought our flight tickets, Canada invited us to apply for permanent residence.

We spent our last month in the US getting rid of everything we owned that couldn't fit in four suitcases and gathering documents for our application. We didn't know how long it'd take for Canada to accept our application, but we hoped our sojourn in Curitiba would be a short one.

### The TWA Hotel

As I researched flight tickets online, I realized that if we booked a flight from Buffalo-Curitiba, it would be:

- Very tiring 
- More expensive than booking Buffalo-JFK and JFK-Curitiba as separate flights 

So I thought:

*Why not do Buffalo-JFK on one day and just... take our time there? We can use the money we'd save with the separate tickets and rest at a hotel and fly to Brazil the next day.*

Honestly, I'm still proud of that idea. We were in no rush to return to Brazil, so we were glad to exchange expediency for comfort and some memory-making. It turned a stressful move into a fun trip.

We stayed at the recently renovated [TWA Hotel](https://www.twahotel.com/), and it was magical. Like [*Marvelous Mrs. Maisel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Mrs._Maisel) magical. The retro architecture and decor, the red carpets, the rooftop infinity pool, the views of the runways, the clickety-clack of the split-flap display in the sunken lounge.[^2] Everything was awesome.

### Mixed feelings

Travelling in the pandemic was a pain, but we made it to Curitiba without any problems. There, we'd live in my sister's old apartment, which was a block away from my parents'.

I'd forgotten how much I loved Curitiba, and my childhood neighbourhood in particular. It's beautiful, convenient, and vibrant. I felt silly for having believed for many years that going back to Brazil was a failure. It wasn't. Curitiba is an objectively better city to live in than most places in the US. 

With one caveat: safety.

People get jumped on the street or have their houses broken into more frequently than in developed countries. In fact, there was a break-in in our apartment complex the first week we were there, though our super caught them on camera and alerted private security, who came with the police to arrest them.

And a second caveat: good education is expensive.

We enrolled Samuel in a public school in [Parolin](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parolin), a somewhat sketchy neighbourhood. Since classes were online due to the pandemic, we didn't worry. Had we stayed in Curitiba long enough for the pandemic restrictions to be lifted, we'd have transferred him to a private school like most middle-class families do.

Living in the US or Canada was really just a way for us to address these caveats and enable our children to grow up safely and with access to good education. In most other regards, I like living in Brazil better, and Vero feels most at home in Chile.

### Job worries

Our Canadian permanent residence application was stuck, and I accepted that we could be in Curitiba for a long time, maybe even years, so I spent the rest of 2020 looking for a job.

#### Job counselling

The first thing I did was talk to an employment specialist in Curitiba's Workers' Agency. 

I'd seen on TV how well employment agencies worked in Scandinavia, and I thought the agent I talked to would see my experience and potential, pull some strings, and find me a position in the hidden job market.

But Brazil is not Sweden. The agent I talked to didn't know what a doctorate was, and said that I had no real skills and that I should be a cashier in a grocery store. 

They hadn't been very helpful, so I revived my [job application spreadsheet](/my-story/12-elias.md#year-4-ub).

#### Translator interview

The first interview I landed was for a trilingual translator of patents and technical diagrams. I did well in the interview and practical test, but the company ghosted me afterwards.

#### Music professor interview 1

Then, my beloved [Belas](/my-story/1-from-curitiba-to-provo.md#belas), which by then had been incorporated into a state university, posted an opening with a job description that fit my profile perfectly.

Curiously, the chairperson of the hiring committee was a UB alumnus like me, and a former student of [David Felder](http://www.david-felder.com/)!

Everything worked in my favour, but I still didn't get the job. Positions in Brazilian public institutions are vied for like contests, and I placed 2nd or 3rd—I don't quite remember because there was a suspiciously large gap between the 1st-place score and everyone else.

#### Music professor interview 2

In early 2021, a friend from UB who lived and worked in Chile told me that the [Universidad Austral de Chile](https://www.uach.cl/) (UACh) was looking for a music professor. Again, my profile fit the bill.

I applied, got an interview, and aced it.

Then I got a job offer.

[^1]: Vero learned so much about immigrating to Canada in 2020 that I felt she was knowledgeable as as an immigration lawyer.
[^2]: I'm sad to see that many guests have posted scathing reviews on [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616325-d17741149-Reviews-TWA_Hotel-Queens_New_York.html#review_952355583) in recent years; our experience was super positive.

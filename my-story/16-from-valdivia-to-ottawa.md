*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) and [portfolio](/docs/portfolio/intro) in different areas of this site.* 

## UACh (Year 2)

When we arrived in Chile, Vero and the boys stayed with Karina's family in Linares while I went down to Valdivia with Felipe, Vero's brother, to furnish the apartment we had rented sight unseen. 

I was away for a few days, but Elias didn't take my absence well and side-eyed me for weeks thereafter, clinging to Vero.

### Samuel's 8th birthday

About a month after our family had moved to Valdivia, Samuel turned eight years old. The baby who'd [struggled to be born](/7-samuel.md#hard-delivery) was now a healthy, active, imaginative, and sensitive boy, and I was immensely proud of him. 

Samuel had such a big imagination that when he didn't have any toys to play out a story he had in his mind, he just used his hands, making all sorts of noise and gesticulating all over the place. He did in public, too, without a whiff of self-consciousness. And I always 

He'd taken longer to start talking than most children but was a precocious reader and avidly curious, going from obsession to obsession. First it was trains, next it was black holes, then [*Pok√©mon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon).[^1] 



### Samuel's baptism

Turning eight is an important milestone for members of the [Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/). We often refer to eight years old as the "[age of accountability](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2000/02/the-age-of-accountability-why-am-i-baptized-when-i-am-eight-years-old)" because it marks the transition between the total innocence of infancy and early childhood and the growing moral awareness of older children, making them eligible for baptism. For children "born in the covenant," i.e., to parents who are active members of the Church, eight is the age

#### About discipline

When we lived in Buffalo, I had some misguided ideas about disciplining Samuel. I was scared he'd become a spoiled brat if I didn't punish him, so I could be very stern with him. I never spanked him, but it breaks my heart to admit that I made him take a cold-water shower on two occasions as a punishment for acting out. He'd spend no more than a few seconds under the cold water, but that was enough for him to feel a sort of terror that made him immediately compliant. 

Doing this to Samuel is one of my greatest regrets. I look back and cannot understand how I was capable of that. Parenthood really drives one to their limits.

These mistakes eventually made me realize three things:

- I can't control what my sons will remember from their childhood, so my job is to facilitate positive experiences and hope that they'll outweigh the bad ones in their memory.
- I need to show *and* tell my sons daily that I love them and give them lots of kisses and hugs. To hell with the persistent Victorian notion that affection is "indulgent" and makes children "weak." I want my sons to know that I love them unequivocally.
- I can speed-run wisdom and skip from father-disciplinarian straight to the pure love of a doting grandfather. Why not? I don't believe in "coddling" like uptight Americans.



[^1]: At the time of writing, Samuel is crazy about [*Kirby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_(series)) and spends virtually all his free time either playing *Kirby* games or reading (WiKirby)[https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_Wiki].

*This is a memoir of my adult life. You can find my [resume](/docs/resume/intro) and [portfolio](/docs/portfolio/intro) in different areas of this site.* 

## ¡Hola, Valdivia!

When we arrived in Chile, Vero and the boys stayed with Karina's family in Linares while I went down to Valdivia with Felipe, Vero's brother, to furnish the apartment we had rented sight unseen. 

I was away for a few days, but Elias didn't take my absence well and side-eyed me for weeks thereafter, clinging to Vero.

## About Samuel

About a month after our family had moved to Valdivia, Samuel turned eight years old. The baby who'd [struggled to be born](/7-samuel.md#hard-delivery) was now a healthy, active, imaginative, and sensitive boy, and I was immensely proud of him.

### Personality

Samuel had taken longer to start talking than most children but was a precocious reader and avidly curious, going from obsession to obsession. First it was trains, next it was black holes, then [*Pokémon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon).[^1] 

He had such an active imagination that when he didn't have toys at hand to play out a story he had in his mind, he'd just use his hands and mouth, gesticulating all over the place, narrating, and vocalizing all sorts of sound effects. He did this in public, too, without a whiff of self-consciousness, and I've never reprimanded him for it. 

On the contrary, I've praised his imagination often because I have bitter memories of being told that I was too old for certain activities and tastes when I was growing up. Back then, I guess adults thought it was their duty to push boys to mature as quickly as possible, and since they thought being imaginative was a childish trait, they discouraged it. 

### Baptism

Turning eight is an important milestone for members of the [Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/). We often refer to eight years old as the "[age of accountability](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/friend/2000/02/the-age-of-accountability-why-am-i-baptized-when-i-am-eight-years-old)" because it marks the transition between the total innocence of infancy and early childhood and the growing moral awareness of older children. This means that people older than eight years old are eligible for [baptism](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/baptism) and should strive to make better choices every day.

Typically, children "born in the covenant," i.e., to parents who are active members of the Church, are baptized and confirmed by their fathers on their eighth birthday, and that's what Samuel and I did. 

Vero's family drove hundreds of km south frm their respective locations to attend the baptism, and my parents flew in from Brazil. Samuel's baptism was a happy day for our family.

### Discipline

Sweet moments like Samuel's baptism made me reflect about my shortcomings as a father.

When we [lived in Amherst](/my-story/9-from-orem-to-buffalo.md), I had some misguided ideas about Samuel's discipline. He had a penchant for loud meltdowns and I was scared he'd become a spoiled brat if I didn't punish him hard enough. I was never violent, but I could be stern. Sometimes too stern.

I regret being like this with Samuel when he was a little child. It's so out-of-character for who I am today that I wonder how I was ever capable of being like that. I guess parenting does push one to their limits.

The mistakes I made in my first years as a father eventually made me decide three things:

- I will show *and* tell my sons that I love them daily. 
- I will facilitate positive experiences for my sons so they can remember their childhood with fondness.
- I will skip the disciplinarian tendencies of a father and give my sons the same unrestrained affection of a doting grandfather—or a cat owner. 

To hell with the persistent Victorian notion that showing boys affection is "coddling" and makes them "weak." I want my sons to know that I love them unequivocally, and it is this love that will make them strong and resilient.

## UACh (Year 2)

Classes resumed at UACh in late March. I was invested in the materials that I taught, and students responded well to that. I prioritized content I thought would be equal parts useful and relatable to them and made a lot of music in class. I had fun teaching at UACh, I was productive, I supported my fellow faculty members, and my career was beginning to take flight.

### Dilemma

Then, more than two years after we had submitted our application, IRCC granted us Permanent Residence in Canada. we got our answer from our Permanent Residence application to Canada.

### Workers' strike

## Hello bonjour, Ottawa!


[^1]: At the time of writing, Samuel is crazy about [*Kirby*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby_(series)) and spends virtually all his free time either playing *Kirby* games or reading (WiKirby)[https://wikirby.com/wiki/Kirby_Wiki].

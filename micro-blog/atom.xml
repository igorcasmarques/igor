        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hard pass.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I created my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/icasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn account</a> in 2019, but didn't really use it until a few months ago, when a mentor advised me to. Since then, I've enjoyed connecting with people and micro-blogging about language and writing. The jury is still out about the value of this platform to my career, but I'm hopeful opportunities will come.</p>
<p>However, I feel a little uneasy. The other day LinkedIn suggested a post to me with hundreds of reactions and comments. The post itself was terrible‚ÄîAI-generated in the worst sense of the word. When I checked the comments, they ALL followed the same formula: "[generic praise] + @author". A post by a bot for bots.</p>
<p>Likewise, a few days ago, a post of mine received a similar comment from someone I didn't know. When I checked their profile, I noticed they were commenting random posts like that every 10-15 seconds! I reported the comment on my post as spam, but LinkedIn did not agree, and that was that.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click farms</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sock puppets</a> aplenty, which is disheartening. But some of these users seem real, even though their engagement certainly isn't. What I've found out since then is that there are <a href="https://www.talosgrowth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">companies</a> that, for a fee, will like and comment stuff on your behalf hundreds of times a day so you can increase profile views and "organically" grow your network.</p>
<p>Yikes. There's more warmth in an April snow storm in Ottawa than in consuming bot content on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Last month, I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/hbdjh05jp1Q?si=rPctC1eKngMqzaiC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video by J.J. McCullough</a> and became aware that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/canadian-heritage-patrimoine-canadien/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heritage Canada</a> sends Canada-themed complimentary items to <a href="https://sc-gc.pch.gc.ca/PROMO/Login.aspx?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whoever requests it</a>. And so I did!</p>
<p>Here's what I ordered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a></li>
<li>Three posters (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-symbols-canada.html#a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flag</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-symbols-canada.html#a2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coat of arms</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/official-symbols-canada.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symbols</a>)</li>
<li>Hand-held flags</li>
<li>Stickers</li>
<li>Temporary tattoos</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, ya boy had to edit the written materials. No typos, but I did find two VERY MINOR issues (see the pictures):</p>
<ul>
<li>1 double space between words ("Franco-Albertan Flag")--I PROMISE, I got my measuring tape to count the millimetres</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>1 capitalization inconsistency ("Subalpine fir" instead of "Subalpine Fir")--everything else used title case</li>
</ul>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Editing is more than fixing errors. It's making sure a text is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truthful</li>
<li>Ethical</li>
<li>Accessible</li>
</ul>
<p>A text that hits these three targets elevates the writer and empowers the reader. Editing is thus a conscious effort to maximize communication and human connection.</p>
<p>Last month, I went on a journey because of a typo on a sign. That journey ended in the place that appears in the picture, the historical School Section 10 building in Barrhaven.</p>

<p>Although this journey did not ultimately answer a toponymical question I had, it did help me feel a greater sense of belonging in my neighbourhood because of the places and people I discovered and connected with in the process.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I discovered <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/9gag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9GAG</a> some 10 years ago. I was a stressed-out new father in grad school, and the site was like an emotional IV for me, each funny meme a drop of serotonin. While the site has always had its bad apples, it was easier to ignore the toxic stuff because the site's political content was not as pervasive or as extreme as it has been since the pandemic.</p>
<p>I'm a technical writer and the intersection of political memes, propaganda, and technical writing interests me. I'm also a programmer, so I decided to code a dynamic pie chart to try and quantify the unease I feel with political content on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/9gag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9GAG</a>.</p>
<p>As the GIF below shows, about half of the content on the Trending page has no political agenda, a quarter is (mostly right-wing) political propaganda, and a few posts here and there are outright chauvinistic.</p>

<p>As soon as I fix a few critical bugs in the pie chart app, I'll go down <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/9gag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9GAG</a>'s rabbit hole to try and understand its political culture and the people (and bots) behind it.</p>]]></content>

<p>This International Women's Day, I'm thinking of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gail-tilden-a6a3295/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gail Tilden</a>, who has had a huge impact on my life.</p>
<p>Gail was the VP of Brand Management at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo of America</a> between 1985 and 2007 and oversaw much of the company's localization effort. I think it's fair to say that many of the games that shaped who I am did so because they went through Gail's filter before reaching me. Thanks, Gail.</p>
<p>Check the video linked above. It's me playing a tune from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, composed by Koji Kondo and arranged for piano by Shinobu Amayake. Gail is the one who came with this game's epic subtitle.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm a technical writer because I'm a language nerd. Always have been. As a language nerd, one of my goals is to become fluent in a new language every decade that I live.</p>
<ul>
<li>In my first decade, I learned Portuguese. It was very easy on account of me being from Brazil.</li>
<li>In my second decade, I learned English. Or rather, I thought I did until I moved to the US, at which point I realized that I actually hadn't. Thankfully, I've gotten better since.</li>
<li>In my third decade, I learned Spanish. It was good enough to woo my wife (see the archaeological artifact below) and it's the language we speak at home.</li>
<li>In my fourth decade, I'm learning French. It's tricky. I've discovered that it's not enough to love the language, you also have to love the people who speak it. I love French, and I'm learning to love the French.</li>

<ul>
<li>"Mayans" isn't technically correct. Use "Maya" for the people and "Mayan" for their languages.</li>
<li>The Maya are still around, in the millions. Referring to Indigenous peoples in the past mythologizes and erases them. Besides, the ancient Maya might have never used MSG, but they never used onions either--it's an Old World crop--and that hasn't stopped you, has it?</li>
<li>You're really going to dis MSG and tap into a debunked (and potentially racist) urban legend? Really? Here's Health Canada | Sant√© Canada: "The safety of MSG has been studied worldwide. All studies found that MSG does not pose a health hazard to people."</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jockvale School in Ottawa is linked with Strandherd Dr and the birth of what is now Barrhaven.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went back to Bruce S. Elliott's <em>The City Beyond</em> to see if his comments about Nepean's School Section 10 (the historical Jockvale School House) would help me discover the origin of the Strandherd name. No such luck but I learned that several historical maps depict SS 10, which I've included in the GIF below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQG0Rt-ieGDIBA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1709227847734?e=1713398400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=mkMEPlIHpmn9gc9vxkbtrEYm-gXUJlCEWuymw22JRIw" alt="Animation that depicts the Jockvale School's location on Strandherd and Jockvale in maps of 1863, 1879, and 1917." class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>SS 10 was founded by Irish Catholics in 1841, not long after they'd settled in the area, so I assume that the school's location was already geographically significant and accessible by then. This means that Strandherd has been there between Jockvale and Greenbank (and likely between Borrisokane and Longfields) at least since the 1840s. It's an important part of Barrhaven's history.</p>
<p>As for the Strandherd name, it was probably given to the road in the mid 20th century by some developer or city planner, and it's unlikely it has a historical tie to 19th-century Nepean. The earliest mention of the name I could find in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/post-media-inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ottawa Citizen</a> is from 1974.</p>
<p>End of the road. I'm starting to feel like Max in Aronofsky's Pi (1998). What started out as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/oc-transpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OC Transpo</a>'s glaring typo turned out to be ... just a typo, after all. It's time to shower, go outside for some -10¬∞ fresh air, and move on.</p>]]></content>

<p>Bad news.</p>
<p>After consulting some books and historians, I realized I had to check the city's by-laws to learn more about the name origin of Strandherd Dr, so I went to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/city-of-ottawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">City of Ottawa</a> Archives.</p>
<p>Nepean's pre-merge by-laws are kept in a vault and have to be requested individually and by appointment. Since all I know are approximate dates, requesting and scanning these microfilms one by one sounds like a lot of trouble for just trivia. No, thanks.</p>
<p>I'll try one last thing before calling it quits: the historic Jockvale School (est. 1841) sits on the corner of Jockvale and Strandherd. Maybe records about the school might be hiding the answer...</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This sign was posted on every single window of the Route 171 bus I rode on yesterday. It aims to keep people from opening the windows but goes about it differently depending on the language.</p>

<p>In English, the command is <strong>positive</strong> ("keep windows closed") and softened by appearing last, after a bit of politeness and the reason we should do it. Likewise, what we should do also appears last in French, but it's a <strong>negative</strong> construction and a subordinate clause of the main imp√©ratif (¬´ Aidez-nous ¬ª). And no SVP in sight.</p>
<p>Instructional signs have to balance proper grammar, limited space, and what sounds natural, cordial, and persuasive‚Äîthings that fluctuate from language to language.</p>]]></content>

Comedian [Graeme Barrett](https://www.youtube.com/@AudioOpera) has a hilarious series on YouTube called [Divorced Dads](https://divorceddads.shop/). It's about a fictional collectible card game Ã  la Magic: The Gathering. When Barrett released the card game for real, I immediately ordered some packs.

The rules are simple and fit on a double-sided 8 x 11 cm (not in) card. Part of the charm of Divorced Dads is its low production value, so I was not surprised to find a glaring typo on the rule card: "scarified" (intentionally scarred for aesthetic reasons) rather than "sacrificed" (discarded from the playing field).

Will collectors one day be willing to pay thousands of dollars for this first-edition misspelled rule card?

Probably not.

Years ago, I was told to place myself last when talking about a group of people. "It's a matter of courtesy," they said. "My wife and I" was good, "me and my wife" was not. Over time, I noticed that one belonged in business speak, and the other in informal speech, so I realized I'd been taught a register of formality.

But there's more to it than politeness. "I" and "me" are different types of pronouns: one is for subjects, the other is for objects. This is why:
 
😊 "My wife and I love food" = Good   
🤨 "I and my wife love food" = Technically OK, but rarely used   
🍪 "Me and my wife love food" = Cookie Monster talk ("me love food")   
😊 "My son called me and my wife" = Good   
😊 "My son called my wife and me" = Ideal   
🙄 "My son called my wife and I" = Grammatically unsound overcorrection

Hi, [FamilyTreeDNA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/familytreedna). 

It's really neat to know that George H. W. Bush and I are distant cousins—VEEEEEEEEERY distant, as our common male ancestor lived over 4,000 years ago—but please have an editor take a look at your content before publishing it. Unlike his son, Bush Sr. famously served only one term; he lost his re-election bid in 1992 to Bill Clinton.

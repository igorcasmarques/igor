Each typo spotted in the wild teaches me something new.

This one at my [local Walmart](https://www.walmart.ca/en/stores-near-me/barrhaven-supercentre-3638) taught me about "shrink" (also "shrinkage"), i.e., the reduction of a store's inventory due to shoplifting, spoiling, and mishandling. This sign was posted at the self-checkout area, so I guess it's there to remind store attendants to keep an eye out for people coming through with these items.

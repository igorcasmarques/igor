As long as they don't ask me to do anything, I love when friends write to me. It's a special thing to exchange text-mediated, long-form accounts of our lives. It rarely happens anymore, what with instant messaging and video calls; it's just not practical.

But there was a time in my life when handwritten letters were my main form of communication. In 2007-2009, when I was a missionary for [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/), I could only communicate with people outside of the area I lived in by mail (with very few exceptions).

Here's a stash of letters that I received during that time:

I can't describe the joy I felt when I found one of these waiting for me in my mailbox. In fact, these letters were so special to me that I eventually married their sender.

I like to read packaging (among other things). 

This line was on a video game case: "⚠️Warning: Cancer and reproductive harm". What an odd thing to say.

I went to the website listed on the case. It's a catalogue of warnings about harmful chemicals by the [Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA)](https://oehha.ca.gov/) of California. There was nothing about video games there, so I have to infer that the warning on my Pikmin 4 case refers to some of the chemicals used to make the game card, such as lead, cadmium, and flame retardants. I checked my other Switch games and, sure enough, several of them have the same warning as well. 

What I've learned is that playing the games is totally safe. Grinding up the game cards and using them as taco seasoning, on the other hand...

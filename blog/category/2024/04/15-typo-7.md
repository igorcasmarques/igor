The tween in me thinks this misspelling is funny because of another word that ends with those two syllables, but I also don't judge the people who made the typo. Schwa (É™) is the most common vowel sound in English because any vowel can make it in an unstressed syllable. Change the "a" in "receptacle" for any other vowel and the word still sounds the same.

It's also interesting that the sign tells us to think of the employees who have to empty the bin. I assume this is to prevent people from disposing of messy garbage because the bin isn't lined with a bag, but I'm not sure. Whatever the reason, it must have been a recurring issue that made them feel the need to include this plea on the sign.

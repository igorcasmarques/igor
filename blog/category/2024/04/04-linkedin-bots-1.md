I created my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icasm) in 2019, but didn't really use it until a few months ago, when a mentor advised me to. Since then, I've enjoyed connecting with people and micro-blogging about language and writing. The jury is still out about the value of this platform to my career, but I'm hopeful opportunities will come.

However, I feel a little uneasy. The other day LinkedIn suggested a post to me with hundreds of reactions and comments. The post itself was terribleâ€”AI-generated in the worst sense of the word. When I checked the comments, they ALL followed the same formula: "[generic praise] + @author". A post by a bot for bots.

Likewise, a few days ago, a post of mine received a similar comment from someone I didn't know. When I checked their profile, I noticed they were commenting random posts like that every 10-15 seconds! I reported the comment on my post as spam, but LinkedIn did not agree, and that was that.

I'm sure there are [click farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm) and [sock puppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account) aplenty, which is disheartening. But some of these users seem real, even though their engagement certainly isn't. What I've found out since then is that there are [companies](https://www.talosgrowth.com/) that, for a fee, will like and comment stuff on your behalf hundreds of times a day so you can increase profile views and "organically" grow your network.

Yikes. There's more warmth in an April snow storm in Ottawa than in consuming bot content on LinkedIn.

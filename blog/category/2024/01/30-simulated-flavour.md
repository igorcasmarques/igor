ðŸ’Š RED PILL ALERT ðŸ’Š

Wake up, sheeple! We live in a simulation! The proof is in your nearby vending machine.

![Picture of a bag of Ruffles chips with sour cream flavouring.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQEnfX-Azeer0w/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1706540802271?e=1710979200&v=beta&t=2XHFbIusCP1oEk6Ms-oX73uNA-_DrHJ0Y3umwcKzceE)

Canadian regulations prohibit food labels to show ingredients that the food does not have. If the label shows the picture of an added flavouring ingredient, then it must clearly state that this ingredient is imitation, artificial or simulated. Each of these words appear in slightly different contexts: imitation is primarily used for aromatic plants (e.g., vanilla); simulated is used for meats and dairy, like the "sour cream" in my chips; and artificial covers pretty much everything else.

Oh, and how did the chips taste? Let's just say it "didn't escape the Matrix" or anything.

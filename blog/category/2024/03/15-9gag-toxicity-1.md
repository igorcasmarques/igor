I discovered [9GAG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/9gag) some 10 years ago. I was a stressed-out new father in grad school, and the site was like an emotional IV for me, each funny meme a drop of serotonin. While the site has always had its bad apples, it was easier to ignore the toxic stuff because the site's political content was not as pervasive or as extreme as it has been since the pandemic.

I'm a technical writer and the intersection of political memes, propaganda, and technical writing interests me. I'm also a programmer, so I decided to code a dynamic pie chart to try and quantify the unease I feel with political content on [9GAG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/9gag).

As the GIF below shows, about half of the content on the Trending page has no political agenda, a quarter is (mostly right-wing) political propaganda, and a few posts here and there are outright chauvinistic.

As soon as I fix a few critical bugs in the pie chart app, I'll go down [9GAG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/9gag)'s rabbit hole to try and understand its political culture and the people (and bots) behind it.

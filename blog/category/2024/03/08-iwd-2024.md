This International Women's Day, I'm thinking of [Gail Tilden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gail-tilden-a6a3295/), who has had a huge impact on my life.

Gail was the VP of Brand Management at [Nintendo of America](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nintendo) between 1985 and 2007 and oversaw much of the company's localization effort. I think it's fair to say that many of the games that shaped who I am did so because they went through Gail's filter before reaching me. Thanks, Gail.

Check the video linked above. It's me playing a tune from The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, composed by Koji Kondo and arranged for piano by Shinobu Amayake. Gail is the one who came with this game's epic subtitle.

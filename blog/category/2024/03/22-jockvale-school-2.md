Editing is more than fixing errors. It's making sure a text is:

- Truthful
- Ethical
- Accessible

A text that hits these three targets elevates the writer and empowers the reader. Editing is thus a conscious effort to maximize communication and human connection.

Last month, I went on a journey because of a typo on a sign. That journey ended in the place that appears in the picture, the historical School Section 10 building in Barrhaven.

Although this journey did not ultimately answer a toponymical question I had, it did help me feel a greater sense of belonging in my neighbourhood because of the places and people I discovered and connected with in the process.

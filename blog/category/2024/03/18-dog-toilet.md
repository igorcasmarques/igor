I'm not a dog owner, so I was puzzled by this sign. There are three icons under "Stoop & Scoop": a squatting dog doing its business; an arrow connecting the waste to a bag; and a toilet bowl.

The ordering of icons suggests a sequence of steps. The first two I get: dog poops, person picks it up. But what about the toilet bowl? Turns out the [City of Ottawa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/city-of-ottawa) "encourages flushing pet waste down the toilet, as it will be properly treated at the sewage plant."

Cool. I had no idea.

This display inside [Mucho Burrito - Fresh Mexican Grill](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mucho-burrito---fresh-mexican-grill/) is typo-free, but it doesn't mean it's great copy either. I didn't mind it too much until the line in the middle. Allow me to edit:

- "Mayans" isn't technically correct. Use "Maya" for the people and "Mayan" for their languages.
- The Maya are still around, in the millions. Referring to Indigenous peoples in the past mythologizes and erases them. Besides, the ancient Maya might have never used MSG, but they never used onions either--it's an Old World crop--and that hasn't stopped you, has it?
- You're really going to dis MSG and tap into a debunked (and potentially racist) urban legend? Really? Here's Health Canada | Sant√© Canada: "The safety of MSG has been studied worldwide. All studies found that MSG does not pose a health hazard to people."

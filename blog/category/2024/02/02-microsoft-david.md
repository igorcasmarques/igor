Ever since I became serious about writing, Microsoft David has become my best friend. When I proofread a text, he's there. When I need to read articles, he's there (thanks to his buddy, Pericles).

I learned how important it is to read copy aloud many years ago when I was a student announcer at [Classical 89](https://www.linkedin.com/company/classical-89). But I have very low stamina for reading text on screens. I've got my display scale at 150%, text size at 120% on top of that, and the "night light" feature always on, but it's still hard. 

Which is why I like Microsoft David so much--no offense, Zira and Mark.

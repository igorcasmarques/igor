This sign at Nepean Woods station told me I shouldn't "lay up," which I didn't understand, so I turned to the French: « Pas d'attente ». No waiting?! Isn't waiting the « raison d'être » of a bus station?

![A sign on Nepean Woods stations says "no layup."](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQFAecNNRaLT1g/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1707490732510?e=1710979200&v=beta&t=umcThxP-LEjg18z7kDL4iPd0NtAsZ1748w-Gzza8Srk)

Turns out the sign wasn't for us, passengers, but for bus drivers. A holdover from nautical terminology, layups are where bus operators can stop their bus and wait until they have to start their next trip. I guess using a French nautical term would've been too esoteric, so they went with the generic « pas d'attente » and let context clarify the meaning.

I love Ottawa's bilingual signage because it reminds me that translation is about context and culture just as it is about language.

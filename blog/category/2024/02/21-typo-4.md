I'm not going to be snarky about the [Ottawa West Community Support](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ottawa-west-community-support/) because they seem like a truly wonderful organization, but isn't it curious that one of their brochures has the same "Standherd" typo seen on the sign of the [OC Transpo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oc-transpo/) station?

![A brochure by the Ottawa West Community Support has a mini-map with Strandherd Dr misspelled as "Standherd."](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQFUpU1yVLx_aA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1708525248349?e=1711584000&v=beta&t=-jRHU_-b1naUoGBYWk3COyCk-9mYEqJJtXgyHwFFCVY)

This was discovered by [Christine Croskery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-croskery-19ba7a158/).

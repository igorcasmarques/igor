I went back to Bruce S. Elliott's *The City Beyond* to see if his comments about Nepean's School Section 10 (the historical Jockvale School House) would help me discover the origin of the Strandherd name. No such luck but I learned that several historical maps depict SS 10, which I've included in the GIF below.

![Animation that depicts the Jockvale School's location on Strandherd and Jockvale in maps of 1863, 1879, and 1917.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQG0Rt-ieGDIBA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1709227847734?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=mkMEPlIHpmn9gc9vxkbtrEYm-gXUJlCEWuymw22JRIw)

SS 10 was founded by Irish Catholics in 1841, not long after they'd settled in the area, so I assume that the school's location was already geographically significant and accessible by then. This means that Strandherd has been there between Jockvale and Greenbank (and likely between Borrisokane and Longfields) at least since the 1840s. It's an important part of Barrhaven's history.

As for the Strandherd name, it was probably given to the road in the mid 20th century by some developer or city planner, and it's unlikely it has a historical tie to 19th-century Nepean. The earliest mention of the name I could find in the [Ottawa Citizen](https://www.linkedin.com/company/post-media-inc) is from 1974. 

End of the road. I'm starting to feel like Max in Aronofsky's Pi (1998). What started out as [OC Transpo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oc-transpo)'s glaring typo turned out to be ... just a typo, after all. It's time to shower, go outside for some -10Â° fresh air, and move on.

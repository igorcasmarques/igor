This sign was posted on every single window of the Route 171 bus I rode on yesterday. It aims to keep people from opening the windows but goes about it differently depending on the language.

![A bilingual sign on a bus that instructs users to keep the windows closed differently depending on the language.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQFJ_vWX5oPKrg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1707929891987?e=1710979200&v=beta&t=EphELRj5W0BzCFyrcaTio-BX7-vCcAm5ddjvu9fAmGo)

In English, the command is **positive** ("keep windows closed") and softened by appearing last, after a bit of politeness and the reason we should do it. Likewise, what we should do also appears last in French, but it's a **negative** construction and a subordinate clause of the main impératif (« Aidez-nous »). And no SVP in sight.

Instructional signs have to balance proper grammar, limited space, and what sounds natural, cordial, and persuasive—things that fluctuate from language to language.

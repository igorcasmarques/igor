Bad news. 

After consulting some books and historians, I realized I had to check the city's by-laws to learn more about the name origin of Strandherd Dr, so I went to the [City of Ottawa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/city-of-ottawa) Archives.

Nepean's pre-merge by-laws are kept in a vault and have to be requested individually and by appointment. Since all I know are approximate dates, requesting and scanning these microfilms one by one sounds like a lot of trouble for just trivia. No, thanks.

I'll try one last thing before calling it quits: the historic Jockvale School (est. 1841) sits on the corner of Jockvale and Strandherd. Maybe records about the school might be hiding the answer...

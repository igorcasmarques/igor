Remember that grotesque [traffic sign from Québec](13-say-quoi-2.md) that said « Attention à nos enfants » and depicted a hurt child lying on the ground? Compare it to this one by the [City of Ottawa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/city-of-ottawa):

![A bilingual traffic sign in Ottawa that reads, "Slow down for us," and depicts silhouettes of children at play.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQFuiyUAuZZywQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1708214563073?e=1711584000&v=beta&t=rNzEDCJ61baV4jlDrhV0D0wlLw0Zmey9EhsXdI_sMnE)

- Same message &#8594; "slow down"
- Same concept &#8594; text + picture of children
- Different execution &#8594; the children are alive (and having fun)

Which one is more effective in making drivers slow down and preventing accidents, I wonder ... and if it's the panneau québecois, does the end justify the means?

Elliott\'s *The City Beyond* to see if his comments about Nepean\'s School Section 10 (the historical Jockvale School House) would help me discover the origin of the Strandherd name.

This means that Strandherd has been there between Jockvale and Greenbank (and likely between Borrisokane and Longfields) at least since the 1840s. It\'s an important part of Barrhaven\'s history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the Strandherd name, it was probably given to the road in the mid 20th century by some developer or city planner, and it\'s unlikely it has a historical tie to 19th-century Nepean.

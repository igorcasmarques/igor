Since then, I\'ve enjoyed connecting with people and micro-blogging about language and writing. The jury is still out about the value of this platform to my career, but I\'m hopeful opportunities will come.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I feel a little uneasy. The other day LinkedIn suggested a post to me with hundreds of reactions and comments. The post itself was terrible\u2014AI-generated in the worst sense of the word. When I checked the comments, they ALL followed the same formula: \\"[generic praise] + @author\\". A post by a bot for bots.\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, a few days ago, a post of mine received a similar comment from someone I didn\'t know. When I checked their profile, I noticed they were commenting random posts like that every 10-15 seconds! I reported the comment on my post as spam, but LinkedIn did not agree, and that was that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m sure there are [click farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_farm) and [sock puppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account) aplenty, which is disheartening. But some of these users seem real, even though their engagement certainly isn\'t. What I\'ve found out since then is that there are [companies](https://www.talosgrowth.com/) that, for a fee, will like and comment stuff on your behalf hundreds of times a day so you can increase profile views and \\"organically\\" grow your network.\\r\\n\\r\\nYikes.

Elliott\'s *The City Beyond* to see if his comments about Nepean\'s School Section 10 (the historical Jockvale School House) would help me discover the origin of the Strandherd name. No such luck but I learned that several historical maps depict SS 10, which I\'ve included in the GIF below.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Animation that depicts the Jockvale School\'s location on Strandherd and Jockvale in maps of 1863, 1879, and 1917.](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E22AQG0Rt-ieGDIBA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1709227847734?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=mkMEPlIHpmn9gc9vxkbtrEYm-gXUJlCEWuymw22JRIw)\\r\\n\\r\\nSS 10 was founded by Irish Catholics in 1841, not long after they\'d settled in the area, so I assume that the school\'s location was already geographically significant and accessible by then. This means that Strandherd has been there between Jockvale and Greenbank (and likely between Borrisokane and Longfields) at least since the 1840s. It\'s an important part of Barrhaven\'s history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the Strandherd name, it was probably given to the road in the mid 20th century by some developer or city planner, and it\'s unlikely it has a historical tie to 19th-century Nepean. The earliest mention of the name I could find in the [Ottawa Citizen](https://www.linkedin.com/company/post-media-inc) is from 1974. \\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the road.
